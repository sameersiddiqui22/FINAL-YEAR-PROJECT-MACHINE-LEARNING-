Drive AI: Car Price Prediction & Market Insights
Final Year Project
This project predicts car prices in the Pakistani auto market using machine learning and provides insightful market analytics. The application is built with Flask (Python) for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The app collects data from PakWheels, Kaggle, and OLX, and uses a Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on user inputs.
